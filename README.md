## API Keys

Seting a `.env` file is reccommended for security. Simply changed the file name from `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `your_key`.

However, if you're only running and testing out the note, you could also add your API keys like this:

```
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_key"
os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = "your_key"
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your_key"
```
